# Nightmare Peggle v1.1 👁️🎯

A single-file horror tribute to Peggle. Fire an eldritch eyeball through cursed pegs, feed a ravenous bucket trap, and ride the Fear Meter from uneasy ambience to full-on glitches and jump-scares.

## ✨ What’s New in 1.1
- **Fresh Power Suite** – Astral Prism, Voltaic Lash, and Graven Well replace the old power-ups with unique mechanics and bespoke sprites.
- **Scare Pass** – The bucket trap is now a fanged, breathing maw with nastier audio.

- **Release polish** – Credits screen, responsive fixes, version tagging.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay
| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Aim | Move the mouse or drag (mobile). |
| Shoot | Click / tap / press Space. |
| Goal | Clear every **cursed red peg** before you run out of eyeballs. |
| Catch | Land in the bucket beast to reclaim a ball and juice your streak. |

### Power-Ups
- **Astral Prism** – Phase through two pegs before gravity snaps back.
- **Voltaic Lash** – Chain lightning across nearby targets with each hit.
- **Graven Well** – Detonate a gravity blast to shred clustered pegs.

Fear rises as you sustain streaks; higher tiers distort the CRT, spawn hallucinations, and eventually trigger jumpscares.

### Level Lab (Beta)
- Import/export JSON layouts with a built-in editor.
- Save custom levels locally and launch them straight into Freeplay.
- Share the exported JSON blob with friends to swap nightmares.
